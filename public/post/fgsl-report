Before I became a Fedora Project contributor, I went to an event
in the central west region of Brazil called FGSL (
"Fórum Goiano de Software Livre"), which had its 12th edition in 2015. It was a great event, and now (
2016) that I have joined the Fedora Community as a contribuitor I thought
about being there again, this time representing the Fedora Project.

I invited some of my friends who are Fedora Project ambassadors to attend FGSL
and they told me that I should also attend the event, even if I am not an
ambassador as well, so we went to Goiânia ro represent Fedora there.

The attendees were Ana Mativi (mativi), Athos Ribeiro (athoscr) and me
(fredlima). On the first day, Friday, November 18, we stayed at our table in the event check-in and registration area
receiving the crowd, promoting the upcoming speeches, answering questions
about the Fedora Project and giving some swag that we took to the event.

On the second day, Saturday, November 19, we gave 3 speeches, the first one was
"Localização no Fedora: Removendo as barreiras de idioma.", which could be translated
as "Fedora Localization: Removing the language barrier" presented by Ana Mativi
and me, at 9:00 to 9:50 AM. We spoke about the Fedora l10n team and how to
contribute as an translator.

The second speech, "Fedora Project - Mesa Redonda" translated as "Fedora Project
– Rounda Table" was given by Ana Mativi, Athos Ribeiro and me, at 11:00 –
11:50, we spoke about the Fedora Project itself and how to join and contribute.

The last one was "O que é um gerenciador de pacotes?" translated as "What is a
package manager" presented by Athos Ribeiro. he spoke about
package management and the RPM package manager.

There were some problems with the place where the event was held
this year and some lack of care by the event organizers, but the
objective was reached.
